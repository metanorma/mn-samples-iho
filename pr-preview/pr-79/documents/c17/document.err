HOs are well placed to support SDIs in that it provides a natural extension in the management and dissemination of the underpinning hydrographic information to a wider user community in an integrated manner. All HOs should therefore carefully consider how they might engage and play a full role in the development of, or participation in a SDI. <xref target="annexG" style="short"/> show possible ways for a HO to engage in SDI.</p>
