The provision and utilization of such data in a standardized format is essential to support the safe and precise navigation of marine vessels, and furthermore an important basis for many other maritime applications.</p>

All of the required attributes from the other classes in the application schema are satisfied by statements within the Product Specification. This approach to producing the Application Schema results in a very simple structure for implementation.</p>

All gridded datasets should be exposed to rigid Quality Assurance/Control procedures to ensure the final gridded dataset accurately represents the real-world environment. Once a dataset passes an established Quality Assurance/Control process, modern chart production software is used to extract candidate nodal depths from the grid for consideration as final charted soundings.</p>

These systems provide great target detection capability and allow for the production of highly detailed images of the seafloor. It must be understood that this capability comes at a price. These systems collect a tremendous amount of information which requires sufficient processing power and data storage to reduce an overwhelming quantity of depth estimates to a manageable number for charting production. The following example describes one method to grid high-resolution multibeam sonar data. This example additionally shows the relationship of a product scale grid to the actual charted sounding.</p>
