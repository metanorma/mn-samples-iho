Trusted Nodes may assist the mariner by supplying data logging equipment, providing technical support to vessels, downloading data from data loggers, and providing the information to the DCDB. The DCDB works with each Trusted Node to standardize metadata and data formats and define data delivery requirements. This model normalises data contributions and minimizes the requirements and effort for mariners.</p>

The flow diagram is of generic nature. The filtered flow of CSB data will be based on the information received by the IHO Secretariat from individual coastal states on request. Further details of which coastal states support CSB activities within their waters of national jurisdiction, along with any caveats they have articulated, will available from the IHO website. CSB data, collected within waters of national jurisdiction of coastal states who did not notify their respective CSB support towards the IHO Secretariat, will not be ingested. This data will be stored and only made available at such time as authorization is received by the IHO from the respective coastal state.</p>

The following sections provide basic information about sensors, as well as best practices and recommendations for collecting CSB.

	<title>Echo-sounders</title>
	<p id="_9750e8d4-2ac2-635f-ba03-7051c628191b">Echo-sounders, or depth sounders, determine the water depth by transmitting sound pulses from a transducer, and recording the time it takes for the sensor to receive the return echo from the seafloor. Transducers are usually mounted on the hull of a vessel, but can be mounted on other platforms, as well. There are two main types of echo-sounders: single beam and multibeam. Either of these echo-sounders can be used to collect crowdsourced bathymetry, however the guidance developed in this document will focus on single beam CSB, as the Trusted Node/DCDB model is currently equipped to receive and process those data. Vessels using multibeam for safety of navigation purposes and wishing to contribute their single profiles should submit their data to the appropriate coastal state national Hydrographic Office under cover of a Hydrographic Note.</p>

	<p id="_4c166a28-3e58-261f-5876-d0f921744e85">It is helpful for mariners to understand the raw data that is being output by their sensors. Many marine sensors, such as GNSS positioning systems or echo-sounder transducers, transmit data in accordance with standards developed by the <link target="https://www.nmea.org/">National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA)</link>. The NMEA 0183 standard data format, or ‘sentences,’ are both human- and machine-readable, and provide information about the sensor measurement and status. All NMEA sentences begin with a $, and each field is comma-delimited. There are many different types of NMEA sentences. The following sections describe a few that may be useful for CSB data collection.</p>

Some systems are programmed to incorporate these offsets when the sensors are installed. If they do not, mariners should record these measurements as best as possible, and include them in their metadata. The following sections provide information about these measurements, and best practices for collecting and recording them.</p>

If the metadata are also consistent, it is easier to incorporate the data into a database, and for users to manipulate the data for their own purposes.</p>

These uncertainty concerns are mostly about validation and processing of the data, and therefore can only truly be assessed at the Trusted Node, or from the DCDB as a whole. It is expected that data collectors are unlikely to be able to assess these types of uncertainty, although they may find the information of interest.</p>
