== Data and Metadata

=== Data vs. Metadata

It is important to understand the difference between data and metadata. Data is the core information, and metadata describes the data. For crowdsourced bathymetry, the data are the depths and geographic positions collected by a vessel, along with the date and time that they were collected. The metadata provides additional, supporting information about the data, such as the make and model of the echo- sounder and GNSS, the vessel's draft, where the sensors were installed on the vessel, and so forth.

=== The Importance of Metadata

Metadata provides information to data users that helps them determine the quality of the data, and therefore use the data for more applications than would be possible with depth and position information alone. If the metadata are also consistent, it is easier to incorporate the data into a database, and for users to manipulate the data for their own purposes.

==== Tidal Information

Crowdsourced bathymetry that is submitted to the IHO DCDB should not have tidal corrections applied. This keeps the data in a standard format. If the data collector provides information about the time and date when a depth measurement was collected, it allows future data users to apply tidal corrections to the data, if they so choose.

==== Sensor Offsets

Information about a transducer's vertical offset from the waterline, or its horizontal offset from a GNSS receiver, allow users to apply vessel draft and horizontal positioning corrections to the data.
By applying corrections based on information in the metadata, data users can greatly improve the accuracy and value of the bathymetric data for research, industry, or other applications. Refer to section 2.3.1 for more information about sensor offsets.

=== Metadata and Data Formats

This section provides guidance to data collectors and Trusted Nodes about the standard metadata that is required for submitting data to the DCDB. In addition, it provides information about additional metadata that would enhance the value of the data for end users. Mariners should collect and forward this information whenever possible.

==== Required Data

A minimum of information is required, to enable Trusted Nodes to receive and process crowdsourced bathymetry for delivery to the DCDB. <<table-1>> lists the required information.

[[table-1]]
.Required Information
[cols="a,a,a",options="header"]
|===
|Data Field | Description | Example

| Longitude
| The vessel's longitudinal geographic position, in WGS84 decimal degrees, to a precision of six decimal places. This can be extracted from the NMEA RMC, GGL or GGA String. Negative values are in the western hemisphere; positive values are in the eastern hemisphere.
| -19.005236

| Latitude
| The vessel's latitudinal geographic position, in WGS84 decimal degrees, to a precision of six decimal places. This can be extracted from the NMEA GGA, GLL or RMC String. Negative values are in the southern hemisphere; positive values are in the northern hemisphere.
| 40.914812

| Depth
| The distance from the echo-sounder to the seafloor. Should be collected as a positive value, in metres, with decimetre precision. This can be extracted from the NMEA DBT, DBK or DBS data string. DBT will require additional information about the draft of the vessel. DBS incorporates the draft of the vessel into the overall depth measurement.
| 7.3

| Date & Timestamp
| The date and UTC time stamp for the depth measurement. This can be extracted from the NMEA RMC string.

==== Optional Metadata

Additional information about the vessel, sensors, and sensor installation allows data users to assess the
quality of the data, and apply corrections, if necessary. This greatly increases the potential applications
of the data for oceanographic research, scientific and feasibility studies and other uses. <<table-2>> lists metadata that mariners should provide whenever possible.

[[table-2]]
.Optional Metadata
[cols="a,a,a",options="header"]
|===
|Metadata Field | Description | Example

| Vessel Type
| The type of vessel collecting the data, such as a cargo ship, fishing vessel, private vessel, research vessel, etc.
| Private vessel

| Vessel Name
| The name of the vessel, in open string format.
| White Rose of Drachs

| Vessel Length
| The length overall (LOA) of the vessel, expressed as a positive value, in metres, to the nearest metre.
| 65

| ID Type
| ID numbers used to uniquely identify vessels. Currently, only two types are available: Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI) or International Maritime Organization (IMO) number. The MMSI number is used to uniquely identify a vessel through services such as <<term-ais,AIS>>. The IMO number is linked to a vessel for its lifetime, regardless of change in flag or ownership. Contributors may select only one ID Type.
| MMSI

| ID Number
| The value for the ID Type. MMSI numbers are often nine digits, while IMO numbers are the letters "`IMO,`" followed by a seven- digit number.
| 369958000


| Sensor Type Sounder
| This indicates the type of echo-sounder. The only current option is 'Sounder.'' 'Sounders' are simple single beam echo- sounders. In the future, 'Multibeam' may be added as an option. 'Multibeam' refers to vessels equipped with swath sonar systems.
| Sounder

| Sounder Make
| The make of the echo-sounder system. This information may be obtained from a list provided by a Trusted Node.
| Sperry Marine (L3 ELAC)

| Sounder Model
| A free-text value, which provides information about the echo-sounder model. In the future, a list of sounder models may be provided through Trusted Nodes.
| ES155100-2

| Sounder Frequency
| A free-text value, which provides information about the operating frequency of the echo-sounder. In the future, a list of transducer frequencies may be provided through Trusted Nodes.
| Dual Freq 200/400 kHz

| Sounder Draft
| The vertical distance, in metres, from the waterline to the echo-sounder's transducer. The draft should be expressed as a positive value, in metres, with decimetre or better precision if possible. For vessels that operate with a range of drafts, recommended to put in the summer load line.
| 4.6

| Uncertainty of Sounder Draft
| The data contributor's estimate of the uncertainty of the echo-sounder's draft measurement, expressed as metres. Vessel draft may be affected by cargo, fuel, or other factors. It is helpful for the data contributor to provide an estimate of how these factors may have affected the transducer's normal depth below waterline, at the time of data collection. Refer to chapter on Uncertainty for more information about how to calculate this value.
| 1.0

| Sounder Draft Applied
| Some echo-sounder systems apply vessel draft in real-time. This field allows the data contributor to state whether draft corrections were applied during data collection ('True') or if they were not ('False').
| False

| Sound Speed Applied
| Some systems may have the ability to provide sound speed data and correct the sounding. This field allows the data contributor to state whether sound speed corrections were applied during data collection ('True') or if they were not ('False')
| False

| Reference point for Depth
| The reference point is the location on the vessel to which all echo-sounder depths are referenced. Echo-sounder depths can be referenced to the waterline, the vessel's keel, the echo-sounder transducer, or the GNSS receiver. Information about the reference point helps data users standardise the depth data to a common water level.
| Transducer


| Sensor Type GNSS
| This field defines the sensor type for GNSS receivers. This must always be defined as: "`GNSS,`" and is not a value that data contributors can change.
| GNSS

| Litton Marine Systems

| GNSS Model
| The model of the vessel's GNSS receiver, which may be selected from a list provided by a Trusted Node.
| LMX420

| Longitudinal Offset from GNSS to Sounder
| This is the longitudinal (fore-and-aft) measurement (offset) between the GNSS receiver and the echo-sounder's transducer. This value should be expressed in metres, with centimetre precision. If the GNSS receiver is aft of the sounder, the measurement value is positive. If the GNSS receiver is forward of the sounder, the measurement value is negative.
| 3.52


| Lateral Offset from GNSS to Sounder
| This is the lateral (athwartships) measurement from the GNSS receiver to the echo-sounder. This value should be expressed in metres, with centimetre precision. If the GNSS receiver is on the port side of the echo-sounder, the value is positive. If the GNSS is on the starboard side of the echo-sounder, the value is negative.
| -0.76

| Position Offsets Applied
| This field describes whether the final vessel position (longitude and latitude) has been corrected for the lateral and longitudinal offsets between the GNSS receiver and the echo-sounder transducer ("`True`"), or if they were not ("`False`").
| False

| Contributor comments
| If the contributor believes there were any problems or events that may have degraded the quality of the position or depth measurements, they can enter that information in this free-text field.
