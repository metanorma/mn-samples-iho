.IHO Statement on Crowdsourced Bathymetry

Crowdsourced bathymetry (CSB) is the collection of depth measurements from vessels, using standard
navigation instruments, while engaged in routine maritime operations. The International Hydrographic
Organization (IHO) has a long history of encouraging the collection of crowdsourced bathymetry, to help
improve mankind’s understanding of the shape and depth of the seafloor.

The General Bathymetric Chart of the Ocean (GEBCO) project was initiated in 1903 by Prince Albert I of
Monaco to provide the most authoritative, publicly-available bathymetry (depth maps) of the world's
oceans. Over the years, the GEBCO project, now jointly overseen by the IHO and the Intergovernmental
Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO, has produced maps of the ocean floor from depth
measurements collected by vessels as they journeyed across the oceans. These "`passage soundings`" have
enabled the creation of progressively more-detailed seafloor maps and digital data grids. More recently,
systematic surveys have also been used to improve the maps and grids.

Unfortunately, despite the multitude of data that have been collected since 1903, less than fifteen percent
of the world’s ocean depths have been measured; the rest of the data used to compile seafloor maps are
estimated depths. These estimated depths are largely derived from satellite gravity measurements, which
can miss significant features and provide only coarse-resolution depictions of the largest seamounts,
ridges and canyons. Progress in mapping coastal waters is only marginally better. IHO publication C-55,
Status of Surveying and Charting Worldwide, indicates that about fifty percent of the world’s coastal
waters shallower than 200 metres remain unsurveyed.

While the hydrographic and scientific community lament this lack of data, the world’s interest in seas,
oceans and waterways continues to increase. The concept of a blue economy is firmly established, along
with an ever-growing public awareness of mankind’s dependence upon, and vulnerability to, the sea.
Several high-level global initiatives are now in place that seek to address ocean issues, including the United
Nation’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Agreement under the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030.
In this context, the shortfall in bathymetric data is even more significant, as it is now recognised
that knowledge of the depth and shape of the seafloor underpins the safe, sustainable, and cost-effective
execution of almost every human activity on, or beneath, the sea.

In 2014, the IHO, at its Fifth Extraordinary International Hydrographic Conference (EIHC-5), determined
to improve this situation by progressing actions to improve the collection, quality and availability of
hydrographic data worldwide. One of these actions, Proposal 4, concerned crowdsourced bathymetry.

The EIHC-5, considering Proposal 4, and the comments made during the Conference, decided, in Decision
8, to task the Inter-Regional Coordination Committee (IRCC) to establish a working group to prepare a
new IHO publication on policy for crowdsourced bathymetry.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) carriage requirements oblige
all commercial vessels to be equipped with certified echo-sounders and satellite-based navigation
systems. As a result, the world’s commercial fleet represents a significant, untapped source of potential
depth measurements. While CSB data may not meet accuracy requirements for charting areas of critical
under-keel clearance, it holds limitless potential for myriad other uses. If vessels collect and donate depth
information while on passage, the data can be used to identify uncharted features, to assist in verifying
charted information, and to help confirm that existing charts are appropriate for the latest traffic patterns.
Crowdsourced bathymetry can also provide vital information to support national and regional
development activities, and scientific studies in areas where little or no other data exists.
Recognizing the relevance of bathymetry to international maritime policy and the blue economy and
noting that crowdsourced bathymetry may be useful for many potential users of the world’s seas, oceans
and waterways, the IHO has developed this guidance document to state its policy towards, and provide
best practices for collecting, crowdsourced bathymetry. It is hoped that this document will provide
volunteer data collectors and interested parties with guidelines for gathering and assessing the quality of
CSB data.

*This document provides technical guidelines only that in no way supersede national or international laws and regulations.*
