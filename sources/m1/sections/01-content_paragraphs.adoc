Dear Minister,

The Intergovernmental Convention on the International Hydrographic Organization signed on 3 May 1967 states that the headquarters of the Organization are established in the Principality of Monaco.

In application of this Convention, the Monaco Government and the Organization envisage the signing of a Host Agreement to define the relevant conditions and to determine the privileges and immunities of the Organization in Monaco.

The Government of the French Republic is concerned in two capacities by this matter.

In the first place, it is, in fact, a Party to the Convention of 3 May 1967 which provides in its Article XIII that the Organization shall enjoy on the territory of each of its Member States such privileges and immunities as may be necessary for the exercise of its functions and the fulfilment of its object.

In the second place, certain privileges or immunities are the subject of special agreements between France and Monaco.

Consequently, and in order to facilitate the functioning of the Organization, I have the honour to inform you that the French Government, for its part, is prepared to adopt the following provisions:

[[eol1]]

The above facilities shall in no way be considered as preventing the relevant authorities from taking appropriate security measures.

[[eol3]]
=== Article 3

Except where reasons of public order preclude this, authorization to enter and to reside in the Principality without charge for visas and without delay for the term of their duty or mission with the Organization shall be granted to representatives of Member Governments and observers from the relevant States who are invited to participate in the sessions of the organs of the Organization or in conferences and meetings convened by the latter as well as experts or persons called by it for consultative purposes.

The provisions of said paragraph <<eol5-1a>> are not applicable to pensions paid by the Organization to its former officials resident in France or taxable in France under article 7-I of the Convention of 18 May 1963 referred to in the previous paragraph.

If the provisions set out herein meet with the agreement of the Government of Monaco, I have the honour to propose that this letter and Your Excellency's reply should constitute the understanding of the Government of H.S.H. the Prince of Monaco and the Government of the French Republic and that this agreement should enter into force thirty days after the date on which the two Governments have notified one another of the completion of their respective formalities of approval.
