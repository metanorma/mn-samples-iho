== Introduction

All components of the hydrographic surveying and nautical cartography profession face challenges as to how best to ensure the continuance of high standards and how best to ensure the continuation of best practices based on minimum standards of competence world-wide. In order to achieve these objectives, three international organizations (FIG, IHO and ICA) have developed Standards of competence that institutions or professional bodies may adopt for their educational/training programmes and competency schemes.

Standards indicate the minimum competences necessary for hydrographic surveyors. Standards recognize two levels of competence. Category "A" programmes introduces competences from the underlying principles level. Category "B" programmes introduce the competences from a practical level.

The intention is that a Category "A" individual with appropriate experience, would be a senior professional in their chosen field (government, industry, academia). Category "B" individuals with appropriate experience would be technical professionals leading and delivering products and services to meet specifications and outcomes.

*Topics and Elements*:

* Each *Foundation Science, Hydrographic Science or Basic* _subject_ comprises a list of _topics_ which are denoted by Bx.y, Fx.y, or Hx.y;
* Each topic contains _elements_ which are denoted by Bx.y<c> Fx.y<c> or Hx.y<c>.

For example, the _subject_ H1 "`Positioning`" contains the _topic_ H1.1 Vessel and sensor reference frames that has the _element_ H1.1a "`Common reference frames for sensors`".


=== Learning outcomes and list of content

It is important to understand that each element is associated with:

* one or more intended _learning outcomes_, that a student should be able to achieve on completion of the programme. All _learning outcomes_ should be assessed. This may be done through one of, or a combination of, the following: examination, assessed exercise or presentation, laboratory report, or final project
work.
* a list of _content_. This list is associated with one or more _learning outcomes_ and describes the theoretical knowledge or practical/technical context which the course syllabi should address in order to meet a particular _learning outcome_.

== Programme preparation and submission

The preparation of a programme submission to the IBSC should be done in accordance with the document entitled GUIDELINES FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STANDARDS OF COMPETENCE FOR HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYORS. This document is available from the IHO website: link:http://www.iho.int/[www.iho.int] -> Standards & Publications.

The cross reference table is a mandatory requirement for a programme submission and *MUST* be completed. A template is specified and is available from the IHO website: link:http://www.iho.int/[www.iho.int]
