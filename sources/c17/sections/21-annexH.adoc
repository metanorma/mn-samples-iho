== Stakeholders to be considered by IHO member states in developing their understanding and engagement in SDI

*Standards / Normalization experts*

To ensure common approach to data standards and specifications is followed (e.g. ISO, OGC)

*National Mapping Agencies/ Survey Departments/Environment Departments*

To discuss interoperability and potential harmonization of land and sea spatial data

*Government contacts in-country*

* Policy level – to identify legislative drivers for SDI
* Administration level – to develop stakeholder involvement
* Political level - to gain influence and leverage through the SDI "Champion"

*Private Sector partners*

To assist in technical requirements for SDI compliance

* Software companies (e.g. CARIS; Esri, Envitia)
* System integrators (e.g. IBM, BAE Systems)
* Data Management specialists (e.g. OceanWise)

*Users*

To identify what customers of HO data require, how and when they require it to be provided

*IHO Working Groups & Committees*

To learn what developments and / or changes to specifications and processes are happening.

*Regional or National Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) initiatives* such as:

* European Commission (INSPIRE): Joint Research Centre in Ispra; Italy http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/[http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/]
* Kartverket – Norway NSDI: http://kartverket.no/en/Systempages/Ordbok/N/NSDI/[http://kartverket.no/en/Systempages/Ordbok/N/NSDI/]
* Natural Resources Canada - GeoConnections (CGDI): http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/earth-sciences/geomatics/canadas-spatial-data-infrastructure/8906[http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/earth-sciences/geomatics/canadas-spatial-data-infrastructure/8906]
* Malaysia (MaCGDI): http://www.mygeoportal.gov.my/international-sdi[http://www.mygeoportal.gov.my/international-sdi]
* Latin America and Caribbean: http://www.geosur.info/geosur/index.php/en/[http://www.geosur.info/geosur/index.php/en/]

*GSDI*

To promote international cooperation and collaboration in support of local, national and international spatial data infrastructure developments. http://gsdiassociation.org/[http://gsdiassociation.org/]

*Other data providers* (e.g. geology, seismic, science)

To enable interoperability at both the organizational and data level

*Other marine/ maritime organizations* (e.g. ports; coast- guards; environment)

To gain a wider perspective on how information and services provided by other organizations impacts on those provided by the HO and to engender collaboration and co-operation in developing SDI capability
