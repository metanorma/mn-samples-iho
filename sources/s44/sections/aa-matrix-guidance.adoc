== MATRIX GUIDANCE

=== Introduction

The <<scl-matrix-description,Matrix>>, as presented in <<scl-matrix>>, includes a range of selectable criteria for hydrographic survey parameters / data types. It is organised by the following data classes: Bathymetry, Other Positioning, Water Flow, and Nature of the Bottom.

The criteria are derived through a series of alphanumeric codes which reference the cells in the <<scl-matrix-description,Matrix>>. A criterion requires three characters to reference a cell address:

. The first character is a capital letter denoting the class of data.
. The second character is a lower-case letter referencing the intended criteria by row.
. The third character is a number referencing the intended criteria value by column.

The string should include only those parameters and data types required for both specification and classification of surveys. Omission of a cell reference indicates that there is no requirement for the associated criteria and that "`0`" should be used in required formulas.

| | Class | Description

| *B* | Bathymetry | Depth and features
| *P* | Other Positioning | Location of features above the vertical reference
| *W* | Water Flow | Direction and speed of currents
| *N* | Nature of the Bottom | Bottom characterisation

=== Examples of Matrix Realisations:

==== Matrix Representations

<<scl-matrix-description,Matrix>> realisations may be communicated in a variety of representations including: diagrams, tables, text strings, and shaded matrices.


==== Table Examples

The following table presents two examples of "`Matrix Realisations`": Order 1a Surveys, and a Customised Specification. This table includes the values associated with a <<scl-matrix-description,Matrix>> cell. Although it may be helpful to provide those values in a technical specification for a survey, it is not explicitly necessary in order to communicate the requirement. Cells in colour highlight the differences between Order 1a and the customised specification, which is more demanding.

==== Text String Examples

The following text strings present examples of "`Matrix Realisations`": Order 1a Surveys, and a Crowd Sourced dataset example.


.Order 1a Matrix text string example
====
Classified according to the S-44 Matrix as:

_Ba8, Bb3, Bc8, Bd6, Be5 (≤40m), Bf3 (>40m), Bg9, ≤Bh9, Pa6, Pb3, Pc3, Pd2, Pe1, Pf3, Pg2, Ph3, Pi4, Wa1, Wb5._

Can be divided into the separate parts as not all parameters need to be surveyed at all times depending on area and survey specification requirements. Classified according to the S-44 Matrix as:

* Bathymetry: _Ba8, Bb3, Bc8, Bd6, Be5 (≤40m), Bf3 (>40m), Bg9, ≤ Bh9_
* Fixed Objects, Aids, Features Above the Vertical Reference Significant to Navigation: _Pa6, Pb3_
* Floating Aids and Objects: _Pc3_
* Coastline: _Pd2_
* Features Above the Vertical Reference Less Significant to Navigation: _Pe2, Pf3_
* Overhead Clearances and Range Line, Sector Light Heights: _Pg2, Ph3_
* Angular Measurements: _Pi4_
* Water Flow: _Wa1, Wb5_
====

.Crowd Sourced Dataset Example
====
A "`Crowd Sourced`" bathymetric dataset acquired in deep water, with a single beam echosounder and no sound velocity correction, could be classified by the use of <<def-tvu,TVU>> and <<def-thu,THU>> (the coverage is of no use as it is not a systematic survey):

Classified according to the S-44 Matrix as: _Ba3, Bc5, Bd3_
====

*Referencing:*

The use of text strings for classification of datasets should be articulated with a clear reference to the <<ch-safety-navigation-surveys,S-44 Survey Order>> and / or <<scl-matrix-description,Matrix>>, highlighting any variance from the Survey Order.

Examples could be: "`_Classified according to the S-44 Matrix as: (Ba8, Bb3...)_`" or "`_Classified according to the S-44 Survey Order and Matrix as: Special Order, *Ba12*_`" (where Ba12 shows a further augmentation of Special Order in this case).

NOTE: the use of text strings alone has a higher probability of translation error.
