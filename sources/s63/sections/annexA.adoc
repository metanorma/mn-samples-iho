== Data Server Certificate Request Procedure

=== Purpose

The purpose of this procedure is to define the process for a Data Server to obtain a SA signed Data Server Certificate from the SA as defined by the IHO S-63 Data Protection Scheme Standard.

=== Responsibility

==== Need for Data Server Certificate

An organisation that encrypts and digitally sign ENC data as part of the IHO S-63 Data Protection Scheme will require a Data Server Certificate signed by the Scheme Administrator.

Users of encrypted and digitally signed ENC data (i.e. ECDIS systems to authenticate a signature and decrypt ENC information) do not need a Data Server Certificate. Agents or Distributors who will only provide ENC services supplied by a Data Server will not require a Data Server Certificate.

==== Hydrographic Offices and RENC Organisations

All Hydrographic Offices and RENC (Regional ENC Coordinating Centre) organisations only have to complete Part I of the attached form and include the required information to apply for a Data Server Certificate. A Data Server can only obtain one Data Server Certificate.

==== Non-Hydrographic Offices and Non-RENC Organisations

Other commercial organisations who wish to operate as Data Servers and encrypt and digitally sign ENC information compliant with the protection scheme can apply for a Data Server Certificate. Such organisations must get a Data Server, already a member of the protection scheme, to endorse the request and complete part II of the form. It is assumed that the Data Server providing the ENC data to the commercial organisation will endorse the request.

==== IHO Secretariat

The IHO Secretariat as Scheme Administrator has the sole responsibility to generate the Data Server Certificates compliant with internal procedures.

=== Definitions

Data Server:: This is the term used to identify an organisation producing encrypted ENC data that is digitally signed and issuing Cell Permits to Data Clients (end-users).

Certificate:: Certificates are digital documents attesting to the binding of a public key to an individual or organisation. They verify that a specific public key belongs to a specific organisation, in this case the IHO.

==== Completion of Forms and Attachments

A Data Server, who is already either a Hydrographic Office or a recognised RENC, who wishes to become a participant in the IHO S-63 Data Protection Scheme, is responsible for providing the following information to the IHO Secretariat:

* Asigned IHO Data Server Agreement
* A signed Certificate Request Form with Part I filled out
* The Data Server's Public Key
* The Data Server's Self Signed Certificate (SSK)

==== Need for Endorsement

All non-hydrographic offices and non-RENC organisations wishing to become a Data Server must have the Certificate Request Form endorsed by an existing Data Server who is already a member of the scheme.

==== Endorsing Organisation

The endorsing Data Server must complete Part II of the Certificate Request Form and return it to the non-hydrographic offices or non-RENC organisation.

==== Submission of Request to IHO Secretariat

The Data Server is responsible for submitting the completed Request Form together with all other information listed in <<completion_of_forms_and_attachments>> above to the IHO Secretariat.

==== Validation of Certificate Request

The IHO Secretariat will validate the origins of the Certificate Request and authenticate the public key by contacting the Data Server. It will also ensure the need for a Data Server Certificate is applicable by contacting the endorsing Data Server. The IHO Secretariat will report discrepancies back to the originator.

==== Creation of Data Server Certificate

The IHO Secretariat is responsible for the authentication of the SSK created by the Data Server. If authentic the IHO Secretariat then signs the Data Server public key to create the Data Server's Certificate, this is then supplied to the Data Server.

=== Quality Metrics

The IHO Secretariat will archive the Data Server Request information and attachments compliant with internal procedures.
