=== Introduction to Data Authentication and Integrity Checking

The digital signature technique used in the S-63 scheme uses a standard algorithm and key exchange mechanism widely used. S63 digital signatures use asymmetric public key algorithms within a PKI-like infrastructure scheme to unbreakably bind a data file with the identity of the issuer.

The scheme relies on asymmetric encryption {blank}footnote:[Asymmetric cryptography relies on algorithms where encryption and decryption take place with different cryptographic keys. Therefore one person can encrypt data and make available a decryption key for others to decrypt it. These keys are referred to as the “private key” and the “public key”, collectively known as a “key pair”] of a checksum of a data file. By verifying the signature against the issuer's public key, and also verifying the issuer's public key against a top level identity the user is assured of the signer's identity. A detailed explanation digital signatures is beyond the scope of this document and the reader is referred to the Digital Signature Standard (DSS), FIPS Pub 186 ( http://www.itl.nist.gov/div897/pubs/fip186.htm[www.itl.nist.gov/div897/pubs/fip186.htm]) for a more detailed and accessible explanation.

The scheme can be considered to have three distinct phases:

. A Scheme Administrator (SA) verifies the identity of a supplier of ENC information and provides the supplier with data to allow them to sign ENC data.
. A Data Server (e.g. RENC or VAR) issues ENC data signed with their identity (and its verification by the SA). 
. The subsequent verification by the Data Client of the Data Server's identity (by its association with the SA) and the integrity of the ENC data.

[NOTE]
====
. The Data Server's Public Key and Self Signed Key (SSK) File are sent to the SA for validation when applying to join the IHO S-63 Data Protection Scheme.
. If accepted the SA signs the Data Server's SSK with its own private key to produce a SA signed Data Server Certificate which is then returned to the Data Server.
. The SA Public Key is widely distributed and installed independantly in OEM systems.
. SA Public and Private Key pairs must be different from all other Data Servers.
. All Data Server Public and Private Keys must be unique to each other and the SA.

[NOTE]
====
If an ECS/ECDIS is using the method depicted above, and if the SA Key Pair is different from the Data Server key pair, then it is able to authenticate and validate ENCs from Data Server 2 (or any other Data Server in the scheme) using the same SA public key.

. *Authentication :* The ECS/ECDIS uses the SA public key, previously installed indepenantly of the CD, to check the certificate part of the signature file to confirm that the supplier's public key in the certificate is valid. That is, the Data Server is a bona fide member of the scheme
. *Integrity Check:* The ECS/ECDIS uses the public key from the certificate to check the signature of the ENC cell (data) file.
====

[[sa_verification]]
==== SA Verification

The ECDIS needs to be able to verify that the ENCs are from a bona fide source. It does this by ensuring that the data server's public key provided within the ENC signature files can be validated against the SA's public key.

The SA provides certificates to each data server in the scheme; each certificate is unique, the SA only has to do this task once for each data server when they join the scheme. To obtain a certificate, data servers generate a key pair and provide the SA with their public key (as a self signed certificate); the SA (using their existing key pair) uses their private key to sign the data server's public key. The resulting certificate contains a signature of the supplier's public key. This certificate is then included within all ENC cells' and updates' signature files.

The SA makes their own public key widely known to the ECDIS community and OEMs should provide a means for the user to load this independently of the data.

[[data_integrity]]
==== Data Integrity

After the source of the ENC exchange set has been authenticated the ECDIS then checks data integrity by validating the signature file provided for each ENC by the data server.

The data server creates a signature file for each cell which consists of the following two parts:

* The signature of the dataset [which is created using the data server's private key, half of the data server key pair (in essence this is an encrypted checksum of the data) and is different for each cell] 
* Their Data Server certificate (which remains constant).

The ECDIS uses the data server's public key that is included in the certificate to validate the data file signature (it decodes this data file signature and compares the checksum against the ENC cell). If this validation check is successful then it proves that the ENC has not been corrupted in any way and that the identity of the Data Server within the cell signatures is validated by the SA.

[[digital_certificates_saa]]
=== Digital Certificates (SA Authentication)

Certificates are digital files issued by a certification authority. They bind a specific public key together with other information to an individual or organisation. Certificates help prevent someone from using a fake public key to impersonate someone else. The scheme uses a chain of certificates, each one certifying the previous one until all parties are confident as to the identities in question. The SA certificate used by the IHO will be a self signed certificate {blank}footnote:[The SA public key signed using the SA private key.] and is the *root certificate* for the scheme.

The SA will issue a digital certificate to all approved Data Servers by signing the Data Server's verified public key file. The following list of high level operations is performed in the issuing of digital certificates.

*Scheme Creation*

* SA creates a unique top level public and private key pair.

*Establishment of a Data Server*

* Data Server creates a unique public and private key pair.
* Data Server creates a Self Signed Key (SSK) by signing own public key file with own private key.
* Data Server supplies the SSK to the SA by a trusted means.
* SA verifies the Data Server's SSK using the Data Server's pubic key.
* SA signs the verified Data Server public key file using the SA private key.
* SA supplies the Data Server with its own unique SA signed Data Server Certificate.

*Creation of Signed Data Sets*

* Data Server verifies the resultant certificate with the SA public key (supplied separately).
* Data Server stores verified certificate and uses it in the creation of ENC signature files.

The format of the various files, certificates and signatures are described in more detail in <<data_authentication_file_formats>>.

NOTE: *the SA public key is made widely available to all interested parties, e.g. Data Servers, Data Clients and OEMs, in a number of ways, e.g. web, e-mail, etc.*

[[the_sa_public_key]]
==== The SA Public Key

The scheme requires that the SA public key is installed on the Data Client's systems independently of the ENC exchange set. This can be pre-installed by the OEM. However, the Data Client system must have a method of installing a new public key {blank}footnote:[It is envisaged that data servers will supply this independently of the exchange set to coincide with data that authenticates against the new public key.] on the system in the case where a new one is issued by the SA.

If the user installs a new SA certificate or public key the system must confirm that a new one has been installed. If installing a new SA certificate (IHO.CRT) the system must inform the user as follows:

*_"A new SA certificate (public key) has been installed this is valid to [enter expiry date] or unless the SA issues a new one for security reasons."_*

If installing a new SA public key (IHO.PUB) the system must inform the user as follows:

*_"A new SA public key has been installed this is valid until the SA routinely issues a new one or unless one is issued for security reasons."_*

Should the system report an authentication error during the loading process it should alert the user to the possibility that the SA may have changed the public key. Therefore a warning message must be displayed explaining the reason for this as follows:

*_"SSE 06 – The SA Certificate/Public Key is invalid. The SA may have issued a new public key or the ENC may originate from another service. A new SA public key can be obtained from the IHO website or from your distributor."_*

[[new_data_servers]]
==== New Data Servers

The IHO, in conjunction with the DPSWG, will establish the identity of any organisation or commercial company wishing to join the protection scheme as a Data Server. If the SA revokes a Data Server Certificate, it will inform all Data Servers and Manufacturers about the change.

[[digital_signatures_vdi]]
=== Digital Signatures (Verify Data Integrity)

A digital signature is an electronic signature that can be used to authenticate the identity of the sender of a message or the signer of a document, and to ensure that the original content of the sent message is unchanged. Digital signatures are portable, easily verified and cannot be forged.

It is also acceptable for Hydrographic offices or other Data Server organisations (e.g. RENC/VAR) to use digital signatures to maintain provenance and data integrity between them in the delivery of ENC information. Each ENC file (both base and update files) will always have a single unique signature file associated with it. No other files in an encrypted ENC exchange set have a digital signature.

NOTE: An exchange set may contain signatures issued by different data servers and therefore each ENC file must be authenticated individually.

[[technical_overview_of_digital_signatures]]
==== Technical Overview of Digital Signatures

Data authentication is provided using a digital signature compliant with the Digital Signature Standard (DSS) [2]. The DSS uses the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1) [3] to create a message digest (hash). The message digest is then input to the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) [2] to generate the digital signature for the message using an asymmetric encryption algorithm and the 'private key' of a key pair. Asymmetric algorithms have the property that data encrypted using the 'private key' of the key pair can only be decrypted using the 'public key' of the key pair.

A consequence of encrypting the message digest with the private key is that anyone who has the public key (which as its name suggests can be made public) can decrypt and verify the message digest.
Further information on Digital Signatures and their use may be obtained from the IHO website (https://iho.int/[www.iho.int]).

[[data_authentication_file_formats]]
=== Data Authentication File Formats

There are a number of files associated with the authentication processes within the S-63 Data Protection Scheme. Among these are the certificate and signature files, as described in <<digital_certificates_saa>> & <<digital_signatures_vdi>> and the private and public keys created to sign and authenticate them. Although these may be derived independently the various component parts contained within each file share common elements that are always formatted in the same way. The following table lists the files that are fundamental to the authentication of S-63 encrypted ENCs. This table also identifies those participants of the scheme who create them.

[[element_header_and_data_string_formatting]]
===== Element Header and Data String Formatting

Each data string:

* Is preceded by a single header line. Header lines are indicated by two forward slashes (// ASCII - 0x2F2F) at the start followed by a space (SP ASCII 0x20) and the header characters in ASCII text as per the format descriptions below.. 
* Is expressed in ASCII text hexadecimal digits (0-9, A-F). Any alphabetic character will be in upper case. 
* Is terminated by a full stop (. ASCII 0x2E). 
* Has a space (ASCII SP 0x20) separating each group of 4 characters. 
* Has a Carriage Return (ASCII CR 0x0D) and New Line (ASCII LF 0x0A) at the end of each data string.

[[examples_of_file_certificate_and_signature_formats]]
==== Examples of File, Certificate and Signature Formats

The following section includes a set of examples of all the various files associated with this aspect of the S-63 Data Protection Scheme. A detailed explanation of how these files are created is outlined later in this document.

[[pqg_format]]
===== PQG Format

The PQG parameters are produced from a random string and are used in the creation of the X and Y private/public key pairs. After these have been made, the PQG parameters will be contained within the X and Y private/public key pairs.

P, Q and G are numerical parameters used in the Digital Signature Algorithm as input to the key creation process. Each data server can use a different set of P, Q and G or use an existing set to generate random key pairs. The Digital Signature Standard [2] describes their derivation and use.

[[the_sa_digital_certificate_format]]
===== The SA Digital Certificate (X509v3) Format

The SA Digital Certificate will be in X509v3 format [4] and represents a DSA Public Key of length 512 bits. The SA Digital Certificate will always be available in a file called IHO.CRT. The IHO.CRT file is available from IHO at https://iho.int/[www.iho.int].

All Data Servers providing an ENC service may include the SA certificate, for reference in the root directory of the media (e.g. in D:\IHO.CRT on a CD-ROM) but, as stated in <<the_sa_public_key>>, the installation on a Data Client's system of the SA certificate should be done independently. The check of the validity of the SA signature against each ENC signature must be done from the independently installed version of the SA certificate.

The SA public key in ASCII format (as opposed to the binary X509v3 format) is also made available on the IHO website at https://iho.int/[www.iho.int] (the format is described in <<the_y_format>>).

[[the_ssk_format]]
===== The Self Signed Key (SSK) Format

This is the file format that the Data Server uses to sign its own public key before sending to the SA for signing. The signature is the signature of the whole public key file (i.e. the PQG and Y parameters).

The second R and S pair is used to authenticate the Data Server digital certificate (p, q, g and y strings). If verified successfully, the Data Server public key (y string) can be extracted and used to verify the digital signature (first R and S pair) of the encrypted ENC. This allows the Data Client to verify the SA digital certificate, to extract the Data Server public key, and to verify the digital signature of the ENC data.
