== Manufacturer Information Request Procedure

=== Purpose

The purpose of this procedure is to define the processes that an OEM has to undertake to become a participant in the IHO S-63 Data Protection Scheme. To participate, OEMs will require their own unique M_ID and M_KEY values. These are supplied by the SA as defined by the IHO S-63 Data Protection Scheme so that OEMs can decrypt S-63 encrypted ENCs.

=== Responsibility

==== OEMs

Only OEMs that develop Data Client applications need a unique M_ID and M_KEY value. The IHO Secretariat as the Scheme Administrator will share this information with all the Data Servers participating in the scheme. An OEM will only be issued with one M_ID and M_KEY pair.

The M_ID and M_KEY values will be returned to the Scheme Administrator if the organisation ceases trading or no longer supports an application that accesses and displays S-63 encrypted ENCs. Data Servers will be informed of such instances so that no new licences are issued for that particular manufacturers system.

There is no need for Data Client to have access to the M_KEY value because it is securely built into the end-user application (e.g. dongle) and supplied to Data Clients in an encrypted form known as a userpermit.

==== IHO Secretariat

The IHO Secretariat as SA has the sole responsibility for generating the M_ID and M_KEY values and supplying them to OEMs and distributing among Data Servers.

=== Definitions

M_ID:: Manufacturer Identification

M_KEY:: Manufacturer Key

OEM:: Original Equipment Manufacturer

Userpermit:: A 28 character alphanumeric string containing the Data Client's HW_ID encrypted with the manufacturer's M_KEY and containing the M_ID.

Dongle:: A hard lock device that contains the HW_ID of the Data Clients system.

=== Procedure

This chapter defines the flow of information, responsibilities and detailed work instructions.

==== Completion of Request Form

The OEM is responsible for completing all information in Part I of the attached M_ID and M_KEY request form. The IHO may wish to require further documentation such as Confidentiality Agreements – these are not detailed here.

Note that an OEM can:

* Only be assigned one M_ID and M_KEY pair
* Must return the information to the Scheme Administrator (SA) if it stops trading or does not deliver products authenticating signatures or no longer has a need to decrypt ENC information.

==== Verification of Request Form

The SA verifies that all information in Part I of the form is completed, or provide information to OEM about missing information.

==== Verification of Signed Confidentiality Agreement

The SA verifies that a signed Confidentiality Agreement is included with the request or already available in the IHO Secretariat archive. If an Agreement is not available, inform the OEM about the mandatory need for a signed Agreement.

==== Confirm Successful Testing with S-63 Test data

Verify that the OEM has completed successful testing of application with the available IHO S-63 test data. If not, request the OEM to complete the defined test procedure before M_ID and M_KEY are provided.

==== Check OEM has no Current M_ID and M_KEY

Verify the OEM has no previously assigned M_ID and M_KEY. If not, inform the OEM about the problem.

==== Creation of M_ID and M_KEY

The SA assigns the OEM an available and unique M_ID and M_KEY combination.

==== Inform About New M_ID and M_KEY

The SA informs the OEM about its M_ID and M_KEY. The SA informs all registered Data Servers about the new M_ID and M_KEY information.

==== Inform OEM about Problem with Request

The SA informs the OEM about specific problems with the request and requests updated information to be provided before a M_ID and M_KEY can be assigned. Further processing of the request is terminated.

=== Quality Metrics

The IHO Secretariat will archive the Request form and all relevant information compliant with internal procedures.
