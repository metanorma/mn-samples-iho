[[data_server_processes_overview]]
=== Overview

Data Servers are responsible for encrypting and signing the ENC information in compliance with the procedures and methods defined by the IHO S-63 Data Protection Scheme.

Hydrographic Offices and RENC organisations are examples of Data Servers. Organisations wishing to become a Data Server must first sign and submit an http://www.iho.shom.fr/PUBLICATIONS/download.htm#S-63[*_S-63 Data Server Agreement_*] _together with a completed_ http://www.iho.shom.fr/PUBLICATIONS/download.htm#S-63[*_Data Server Certificate Request Form_*]. This process is outlined in more detail on the IHO website (https://iho.int/[www.iho.int]).

[[data_server_processes_subsec]]
=== Data Server Processes

The main responsibilities of approved Data Servers operating under the IHO S-63 Data Protection Scheme are depicted in the <<fig18>>. Each top level _"Process Box"_ cross references the particular section where these operations are outlined in more detail.

[[certification_processes]]
=== Certification Processes

[[produce_public_private_key_pair]]
==== Produce Public/Private Key Pair

Data Servers will need to create a Private and Public Key pair as part of the 'asymmetric' encryption methodology adopted by the IHO S-63 Data Protection Scheme. The Data Server's Public and Private Keys are used in the following functions:

* The Private Key is used to sign the Data Server's Public Key to create a Self Signed Certificate (SSK).
* The Public Key is used to validate the SSK before it is supplied to the SA.
* The Private Key is used to sign all compressed and encrypted ENC data files produced by the Data Server.
* The Public Key is used to check the integrity of the ENC data files in the ECS/ECDIS.

[[create_pqg_signature_parameters]]
===== Create PQG Signature Parameters

This procedure is normally performed by the SA and Data Servers during the creation of public/private key *_pairs_*. Although the PQG parameters generated by Data Servers do not need to be identical to those contained within the SA public key and the SA Digital Certificate, the key lengths used must be identical.

[[fig19]]
.Data Server Processes - Create Public/Private Key Pair - Produce & Authenticate Self Signed Key (SSK)
image::image-19.png["","",""]

The PQG file only exists by itself for a short period during the creation of the X and Y files. After these have been made, the PQG file will be contained within the X and Y files

The creation of appropriate PQG parameters is covered in the publication Digital Signature Standard (DSS) <<dss>>.

[[create_private_key_file]]
===== Create Private Key File

The private key is an output of the PQG generating process. The private key must be stored securely and access limited to only those persons that have a need to know.

Unauthorized possession of the Data Server's private key can potentially undermine the security of the authentication part of the scheme. The Data Server will issue a new public key if the private key is compromised. Details of the X file (Private Key) format are contained in <<the_x_format>>.

[[creating_public_key_file]]
===== Create Public Key File 

The public key is an output of the PQG generating process. The public key is contained in the SA signed Data Server Certificate that forms part of the ENC Signature File (see <<the_enc_signature_file_format>>). The Data Clients system extracts the public key element of this file to check the integrity of the ENC data file against the ENC signature. Details of the Y file (Public Key) format are contained in <<the_y_format>>.

[[create_data_server_ssk]]
==== Create Data Server Self Signed Key (SSK)

The SSK is created and submitted to the SA to obtain a Data Server Certificate. The SSK contains the Data Server public key with a signature created by the Data Server. Although the SSK format is identical to the Data Server Certificate defined in <<create_data_server_certificate>>, the only difference is the SSK is created by the Data Server and the Data Server Certificate which is created and issued by the SA.

The SSK defines a signature of the Data Server's public key. The input to the signature should be the Data Server's public key, formatted according to the Public Key file format as described in <<the_y_format>>. The SSK file shall be written as ASCII text with the format, structure and order described in <<the_ssk_format>>.

[[sign_public_key_and_generate_ssk]]
===== Sign Public Key and Generate SSK

This procedure is normally performed once by a Data Server to create its self signed key (SSK) which is then sent to the SA who will use it to create a Data Server Certificate. The details of the digital signature algorithm _DSA_ are covered in the publication FIPS 186 Digital Signature Standard (DSS) <<dss>>. The procedure is as follows:

[type=a]
. Hash the public key file using the algorithm _SHA-1_ <<sha>>. All bytes within the file are to be hashed.
. Sign the public key file (as hashed at 'b' above) by passing the private key file, the hash of the public key file (as obtained at 'b' above) and a random string through the _DSA_ algorithm <<dss>>. This will return the two signature elements ('R' and 'S'). 
. Write these to the self signed key file in the format defined in <<the_ssk_format>> and append the public key file to form the self signed key file.

[[authenticate_validate_data_server_ssk]]
===== Authenticate/Validate Data Server SSK

Data Servers must authenticate the SSK against the Data Server public key to confirm that a valid SSK has been produced.

[type=a]
. Extract the signature elements 'R' and 'S' (i.e. the first two data strings and their attendant headers from the SSK file supplied by the Data Server). This leaves a public key file.
. Hash the public key file using the algorithm SHA-1. All bytes within the file are to be hashed.
. Verify the signature (the elements removed at 'a' above) by passing it, together with the public key file and the hash of the public key file (as obtained at 'b' above) to the DSA. This will return a status valid or invalid. 

If the SSK is valid then it can be supplied to the SA with a copy of the Data Server's public key.

[[store_self_signed_key]]
===== Store Self Signed Key

Any SSK produced by the Data Server must be stored securely in a *_Certificate Register_* and cross referenced with the associated Public/Private Key pair.

[[validate_certificates]]
==== Validate Certificates

[[authenticate_x509_sa_digital_certificate]]
===== Authenticate X509 SA Digital Certificate

This procedure is performed by:

[type=a]
. Data Servers as part of verifying the SA public key required to authenticate the Data Server Certificate
. Data Clients to verify the SA public key to be used to authenticate the digital signatures supplied with the ENC data

The Data Server procedure is as follows:

Manually compare the SA public key contained within the SA Digital Certificate with a copy of the printable public key available from the IHO website (https://iho.int/[www.iho.int]). If the above check fails, the Data Server shall not accept the SA Digital Certificate. Otherwise, the SA Digital Certificate is valid and the SA public key it contains can be used in the production of ENC signature files.

[[authenticate_sa_signed_data_server_certificate_9]]
===== Authenticate SA signed Data Server Certificate

This procedure is performed by Data Servers to authenticate the certificate obtained from the SA before it is used. If Data Servers use an automated means of authentication then the software employed should first check the following:

[type=a]
. There is a certificate available to authenticate
. If available, is it in the correct format as per <<the_sa_signed_ds_certificate_file_format>>

If a failure is reported in either of these two options the process is to be terminated and an appropriate warning given. Otherwise the process to authenticate should proceed as follows:

[type=a]
. Obtain the SA public key from the IHO website https://iho.int/[www.iho.int] .
. Extract the signature elements (i.e. the first two data strings and their attendant headers) from the certificate file. This leaves a public key file. 
. Hash the public key file (obtained from 'b') using the algorithm SHA-1 <<sha>>. All bytes within the file are to be hashed.
. Verify the signature elements (as removed at 'a' above) by passing it, together with the SA Public Key (the key as obtained in 'a') and the hash of the public key file (as obtained at 'b' above) to the DSA <<dss>>. This will return a status (correct or incorrect).
. If the Data Server Certificate authenticates correctly, its signature elements 'R' and 'S' may then be used in the construction of ENC digital signatures. 

[[fig20]]

image::image-20.png["","",""]

[[store_sa_signed_data_server_certificate]]
===== Store SA Signed Data Server Certificate

All Certificates provided by the Scheme Administrator must be stored securely in a *_Certificate Register_* and cross referenced with the associated Public/Private Key pair and SSK.

[[data_management_processes]]
=== Data Management Processes

The Data Management processes includes the creation and management of files for inclusion in an encrypted S-63 exchange set, this includes the following:

[type=a]
. The PRODUCTS.TXT file (see <<enc_product_listing>>)
. The SERIAL.ENC file (see <<serial_file>>)
. The CATD-COMT field of the CATALOG.031 file (see <<the_catd_comt_structure_and_format>>)
. Text and Picture file records in the CATALOG.031 file (see <<directory_and_file_structure_introduction>>)

Each requires careful management within the Data Server's production software and should be generated in accordance with the formats and conventions described in <<data_management>>.

[[encryption_compression_and_enc_signing_processes]]
=== Encryption, Compression and ENC Signing Processes

[[management_of_eck]]
==== Management of Encryption Cell Keys (ECK)

Each ENC is encrypted using a unique cell key and each ENC permit has the capability to store two encrypted cell keys. These keys may be incremented from time to time at the discretion of the Data Server therefore it is important to manage them in an efficient and effective manner.

To create new cell keys and increment existing ones the Data Server will require an application to automatically manage the keys and store them securely. This application must have a method of generating random strings of the correct length and ideally a means of checking that duplicate cell keys are not produced within a set.

[[fig21]]
.Data Server Process - Create and Manage Cell Keys
image::image-21.png["","",""]

The application must be able to create new cell keys as well as manage the incrementing of those cell keys already in service. The following steps show the logical processes associated with key management, the <<fig21>> is used to further illustrate this.

. Get cell name and, if necessary, the edition number and determine whether it is a new cell.
. If new cell make new cell key 1 & 2, if not go to 4?
. Store new keys in the Key Store.
. If not a new cell does the key require changing? If no go to 5, if yes go to 6.
. Exit and keep using the existing cell keys.
. Cell key 1 is now deactivated and cell key 2 now becomes cell key 1 and is flagged as such in the Key Store.
. Create new cell key 2 and add to Key Store. 

NOTE: The incrementing of the cell keys is at the discretion of the Data Server and is based on the business rules associated with service delivery.

Examples of when keys could be incremented as follows:

* The current encryption keys have been compromised.
* Annually or at an interval defined by the Data Server.
* Synchronized with the issue of a cell new edition.

[[cell_key_format]]
===== Cell Key Format

Unencrypted cell keys are 5 bytes long or 10 hexadecimal characters as shown in the example below:

[%unnumbered]
|===
| *Cell Key 1* | `C1CB518E9C` | 5 bytes
| *Cell Key 2* | `421571CC66` | 5 bytes

|===

[[compress_enc_file]]
==== Compress ENC file (base or update files)

This procedure is normally performed by the Data Server on ENC files before they are encrypted. The procedure is as follows:

* Compress the ENC cell file using the ZIP standard <<zip_ffs>> documented at ( http://www.pkware.com/[www.pkware.com]).

The resulting compressed ENC file is used as input to the Encryption stage of the scheme. Only the ENC cell files (base and update) are compressed. This process is always completed before the data is encrypted and signed.

[[encrypt_enc_files]]
==== Encrypt ENC Files

[[base_cell_file]]
===== Base Cell File

This procedure is performed by the Data Server. The ENC file must be compressed before it is encrypted. The procedure is as follows:

[type=a]
. Select the *_Cell Key_* to be used for encryption (see conditions at <<management_of_eck>>).
. Encrypt the ENC file using the *_Blowfish_* algorithm with the *_Cell Key_* (from 'a') to create an encrypted ENC file.

[[enc_update_file]]
===== ENC Update File

This procedure is performed by the Data Server. The ENC update file must be compressed before it is encrypted. The procedure is as follows:

[type=a]
. Select the *_Key_* used to encrypt the ENC base cell file to which the update applies. 
. Encrypt the ENC update file using the *_Blowfish_* algorithm with the *_Key_* (from 'a') to create an encrypted ENC update file.

[[sign_enc_file]]
==== Sign ENC File (Base Cell or Update)

This procedure is performed by Data Servers to digitally sign their ENC data files. The ENC files must be compressed (<<data_compression>> & <<compress_enc_file>>) and encrypted (<<data_encryption>> & <<encrypt_enc_files>>) before they are signed. The procedure is as follows:

[type=a]
. Pass the data server private key and the encrypted ENC file contents to the DSA algorithm <<dss>>. The DSA algorithm will hash the encrypted ENC file using the SHA-1 <<sha>> algorithm.
. The DSA algorithm will return two cell signature parameters (R & S). 
. Write these as the first two data strings within a signature file compliant with the format and naming convention defined in <<data_authentication_file_formats>>. The remainder of the file is to be composed of the Data Server Certificate that contains the public key associated with the private key used to create the signature.

[[issue_s63_encrypted_enc_data]]
==== Issue S-63 Encrypted ENC Data

Data Servers will issue S-63 encrypted exchange sets in accordance with the business rules aligned to their data provision services.

[[licensing_processes]]
=== Licensing Processes

[[decrypt_user_permit]]
==== Decrypt User Permit

This procedure is performed by the Data Server to extract the HW_ID (unique system identifier) in order to produce cell permits for the Data Client system. The structure of the User Permit is defined in <<definition_of_userpermit>>. The Procedure for decryption of the User Permit is as follows:

[type=a]
. Extract M_ID (4 hex characters) from the User Permit. 
. Extract the Check Sum (8 hex characters) from the User Permit. 
. Hash the Encrypted HW_ID (the first 16 characters of the User Permit) using the algorithm CRC32. 
. Compare the outputs of 'b' and 'c'. If they are identical, the User Permit is valid. If the two results differ the User Permit is invalid and the HW_ID cannot be obtained.
. If the User Permit is valid, convert the Encrypted HW_ID to 8 bytes. 
. Decrypt the Encrypted HW_ID using the Blowfish algorithm with M_KEY as the key. The output will be HW_ID. 

Data Servers should confirm that any derived HW_IDs are of the correct length as defined in <<hw_id_format>>.

[[create_cell_permit]]
==== Create Cell Permit

The process to create cell permits is performed by Data Servers based on a Data Client's request. The following process is used to generate Cell Permits in accordance with the structure defined in <<the_cell_permit>>.

[type=a]
. Remove the file extension from the name of the ENC file. This leaves 8 characters and is the Cell Name of the Cell Permit. 
. Append the licence Expiry Date, in the format YYYYMMDD, to the Cell Name from 'a'. 
. Append the first byte of HW_ID to the end of HW_ID to form a 6 byte HW_ID (called HW_ID6). This is to create a 48 bit key to encrypt the cell keys.
. Encrypt Cell Key 1 using the Blowfish algorithm with HW_ID6 from 'c' as the key to create ECK1. 
. Convert ECK1 to 16 hexadecimal characters. Any alphabetic character is to be in upper case. 
. Append to 'b' the output from 'e'. 
. Encrypt Cell Key 2 (CK2) using the algorithm Blowfish with HW_ID6 as the key creating ECK2. 
. Convert ECK2 to 16 hexadecimal characters. Any alphabetic characters are to be in upper case. 
. Append to 'f' the output from 'h'
. Hash the output from 'i' using the algorithm CRC32. Note the hash is computed after it has been converted to a hex string as opposed to the User Permit where the hash is computed on the raw binary data. 
. Encrypt the hash (output from 'j') using the Blowfish algorithm with HW_ID6 as the key.
. Convert output from 'k' to a 16 character hexadecimal string. Any alphabetic character is to be in upper case. This forms the ENC Check Sum.
. Append to 'i' the output from 'l'. This is the Cell Permit.
