== FIELD AND OFFICE EXPERIENCE

The Board acknowledges that work experience in the field or office is an essential component of individual competence. The Board encourages the development of professional certification or individual recognition schemes by regional or national authorities such as Hydrographic Offices and/or professional societies and provides a process described in <<cl-professional-certification>> below, for the international recognition of these schemes.
