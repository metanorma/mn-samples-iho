The time frame over which an individual studies towards a recognized programme cannot be more than five (5) years for a Category "B" Programme and no more than six (6) years for a Category "A" Programme.


=== Minimum Duration of Programmes

The minimum duration of Programmes must be sufficient to allow students to absorb the knowledge through the lectures, tutorials, self-study, practical exercises and the final project. In the experience of the Board, to achieve the above, for a programme (without exemptions sought) delivered full-time in a continuous manner an expected minimum time frame is:
